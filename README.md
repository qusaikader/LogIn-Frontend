# LogIn-Frontend
Hi guys, after recently learning about and exploring the Front-end world I decided to make a login page, which is the most common page found on all websites.


The work is mostly done using HTML,CSS and JavaScript and one of the most famous CSS framework Bootstrap.
I have provided the colour pallete as well as the images used and the code here on github.
